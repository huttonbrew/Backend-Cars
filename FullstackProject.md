Your task is to form into teams and build a full-stack application that utilizes the following stack:

Node
Express
Sequelize
PostgreSQL
bcrypt
Express ES6 Template Engine
This project will focus more on the back-end content we've been covering, but it should have a great front-end too as this is your Full Stack Project

Technical Requirements
Use Express for your backend routes
Use a Postgres database to persist your application data
Use Sequelize for ORM.
All database changes have to be schema migrations with Sequelize.
Your server should serve a website that users can interact with (user actions should trigger CRUD operations)
Accept User Login and Registration
Store Passwords using bcrypt hashes
Break different parts of the code into different files / modules.
You must use Express ES^ Template Engine for HTML templating
Deploy your project to Heroku (easy mode) or Amazon AWS (hard mode)
IMPORTANT: Include a very detailed README. This is a potential portfolio piece and employers will look at the README first!
Workflow Requirements
Create one github repo (add all group members as collaborators)
Collaborate using PRs (Pull Requests), making sure to tag a reviewer for approval
Don't commit anything to the master branch (remote or local)
Instead, work on a branch of master and merge your work in through Github Pull Requests
Have other teammates be Reviewers for you pull requests before merging
Use a feature tracking system for SCRUM, such as Trello or GitHub Projects
We will meet with each team for "stand up meetings" during classtime

Have a README.md file written using Markdown with at least the following:
